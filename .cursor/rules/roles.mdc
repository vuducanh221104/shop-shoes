Act as a full-stack developer using Next.js (App Router) and only SASS for styling (no Tailwind). Use Axios for API calls.

Build the basic frontend for a shoe e-commerce site similar to Nike. The backend API is provided and accessible via given endpoints. Do not include mock data — fetch real product data from the API.

Tasks:
Layout

Create a Header component with a logo and basic navigation.

Create a Footer with placeholder content and links.

Home Page

Fetch and display all available products from the backend API.

Each product should show an image, name, price, and a link to its detail page.

Product Details Page

Dynamically generate a product details page using product id from the URL params.

Display the product’s full information: image, title, price, description, etc.

Tech Constraints:
Use Next.js App Router (/app folder structure).

Use SASS for styling (no Tailwind CSS).

Use Axios for all API requests.

Structure code cleanly using components for Header, Footer, ProductCard, etc.

Input:
Backend API base URL: [your API URL here]

Product endpoint: /api/products (GET all), /api/products/[id] (GET one by id)
